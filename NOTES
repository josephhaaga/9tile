NOTES:

1. Random move approach
	- Many invalid moves
2. Semi-random move approach
	- Eliminate invalid moves and opposite(previous move)
		- opposite(previous move) would cause a loop

Concerns:
	Is [4,2,6,1,3,8,5,'X',7] a solvable board configuration?
	- Lets start with an easier one

Eventually
	- Informed approach using (Euclidean?) distance matrix to evaluate whether solver is moving in 'the right direction'


# Theoretically unsolvable board configuration
# unsolved = [4,2,6,1,3,8,5,'X',7];

# Previously solved board configuration
# unsolved =  [1,2,3,4,6,'X',7,5,8];
